"It says analytics are overrated." That was Dallas Stars centre Tyler Seguin's quip following the team's 5 game series victory over the Vegas Golden Knights in the Western Conference Finals of this year's NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Stars had, of course, been the worse statistical team throughout the course of the series and yet prevailed anyway. This begs the following question: Are the "fancy stats" used in hockey analytics actually useful for anything in a game that relies so heavily on momentum swings, opportunistic scoring, essentially even competition, and sheer luck? To investigate this, consider the following question: Did the Tampa Bay Lightning deserve to win the Stanley Cup?
Additional specific questions may arise for this data set, which relates specifically to the 2019-2020 playoffs, occuring in "bubble" sites in Edmonton, AB and Toronto, ON. If Vegas had prevailed against Dallas would the outcome have been significantly different? What reasons are there for Dallas's apparently unlikely win over Vegas?

To answer these questions, we will use Natural Stat Tricks' data set on the 2020 NHL playoffs (https://www.naturalstattrick.com/games.php?fromseason=20192020&thruseason=20192020&stype=3&sit=all&loc=B&team=All&rate=n). Natural Stat Trick is an independent statistical tool widely used throughout the hockey industry. Data provided in this set is collected for record keeping purposes. The dataset provides information for both teams on every game that was played in the respective bubbles in Toronto, ON and Edmonton, AB to conclude the 2019-2020 NHL season. Its contents provide information for both teams on every game played in this year's playoffs. This information includes TOI (time on ice), Corsi (a measure of shot attempts), Fenwick (unblocked shot attempts), Shots, Shooting Percentage, Save Percentage and PDO (a combination of shooting and save percent) among many others. These measures attempt to show which team "controls" the game, and is therefore more likely, statistically, to win. Some of these measures entails a "fancy stat" which are increasingly used in front-office decisions made for professional hockey teams.
