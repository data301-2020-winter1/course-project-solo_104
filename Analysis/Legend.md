**TOI** : The total time played for the game in minutes. For the dataset this will exist in (60, 150.27) 

**CF** : Corsi is a measure of shots directed on goal including goals, along with misses and blocks. Corsi For is the corsi score for a team (their shot attempts, etc)  
**CA** : Corsi Against (shot attempts against, etc)  
**CF/60 and CA/60** : Relative corsi for and against score oer 60 minutes (the standard game length)  
**CF%** : a measure of Corsi For/Total Corsi *100.   

**FF** : Fenwick is a measure of unblocked shot attempts (those that are on net, misses or goals). Fenwick For is the amount of unblocked shot attempts for.    
**FA** : Fenwick Against.   
**FF/60 and FA/60** : Fenwick For per 60 minutes and Fenwick Against per 60 minutes.   
**FF%** : Fenwick For %, measured by Fenwick For/Total Fenwick *100  

**SF and SA** : Shots for and Shots Against. These are recorded in game. A shot is defined as something that would be a goal (or is a goal) if it were not saved. i.e. a shot that hits the post and bounces away from the net does not count   
**SF/60 and SA/60** : Shots For and Shots Against per 60 minutes.   
**SH%** : Shooting Percentage, or goals for/shots for. 

**GF and GA** : Goals For and Goals Against  
**GF/60 and GA/60** : Goals For and Goals Against per 60   
**GF%** : Goals For percentage, measured by GF/GA * 100   
**xGF and xGA** : Expected Goals For and Goals Against, a measure of how likely each shot is to be a goal. ex. High Danger Chances resukt in higher xGF etc.   
**xGF%**: Expected Goals For percentage, measured by xGF%/Total xG% *100   

**SCF and SCA** : Scoring Chances For and Scoring Chances Against   
**SCF/60 and SCA/60** : Scoring Chances For and Scoring Chances Against per 60 minutes   
**SCF%** : Scroing Chances For percentage, measured by SCF/Total SC *100  

**HDSF and HDSA** : High Danger Shots For and Against, defined as shots directed on net (i.e unblocked and on net) that have a scoring chance value of 3 or higher. It laymans terms, this is shots directed on net from the "homeplate" region of the ice. See images for a dipiction of the homeplate. 
  
**HDSF/60 and HDSA/60** : High Danger Scoring Chances For and Against per 60 minutes.   
**HDSF%** : High Danger Shots For percentage, meausred by HDSF/Total HDS *100.   

**HDGF and HDGA** : High Danger Goals For and Against  
**HDGF/60 and HDGA/60** : High Danger Goals for and Against per 60 minutes   
**HDGF%** : High Dnager Goals For percentage, measured by HDGF/Total HDG *100.   

**SV%** : Save percentage, measure by shots against - goals against/shots against.   

**PDO** : a combination of SV% and SH%, measured by GF/SF + SA-GA/SA. Generally values of PDO that are *higher* than 102 are not sustainable and tend to show that a team is "lucky". PDO is expected to regress to 100. [More on PDO](https://cnsmaryland.org/2017/02/03/how-an-advanced-hockey-stat-measures-luck-in-the-nhl/)
