"It says analytics are overrated." That was Dallas Stars centre Tyler Seguin's quip following the team's 5 game series victory over the Vegas Golden Knights in this year's NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Stars had, of course, been the worse statistical team throughout the course of the series and yet prevailed anyway. This begs the following question: Are the "fancy stats" used in hockey analytics actually useful for anything in a game that relies so heavily on momentum swings, opportunistic scoring, and sheer luck? 
To answer this question, we will use Natural Stat Tricks' data set on the 2020 NHL playoffs (https://www.naturalstattrick.com/games.php?fromseason=20192020&thruseason=20192020&stype=3&sit=all&loc=B&team=All&rate=n). This provides information for both teams on every game that was played in the respective bubbles in Toronto, ON and Edmonton, AB to conclude the 2019-2020 NHL season. Did the Tampa Bay Lightning deserve to win the Stanley Cup? If Vegas had prevailed against Dallas would the outcome have been significantly different? Were Thatcher Demko's heroics in games 5,6, and 7 in the Vancouver Vegas series responsible for Vegas's struggles in the next round? Did the global pandemic and subsequent protection measures affect team performance? Which teams were "lucky" yet still found success in the playoffs and why?

Natural Stat Trick is a () that is used regularly to track the events of a NHL season. Data is recorded for record keeping purposes, and it available for use by the public from Natural Stat Tricks Domain (https://www.naturalstattrick.com/games.phpfromseason=20192020&thruseason=20192020&stype=3&sit=all&loc=B&team=All&rate=n). The dataset contains information for both teams on every game played in this years playoffs. This information includes TOI (time on ice), Corsi (a measure of shot attempts), Fenwick (unblocked shot attempts), Shots, Shooting Percentage, Save Percentage and PDO (a combination of shooting and save percent) among many others. These measures attempt to show which team "controls" the game, and is therefore more likely, statitically, to win.
